AWS Well-Architected Framework Review - Enterprise Edition
Production-grade, AI-powered assessment platform

This module aims to be the de facto standard for AWS WAF assessments by providing:
- Complete question database (200+ questions across 6 pillars)
- AI-powered analysis and recommendations using Claude
- Automated evidence collection via AWS scanning
- Industry benchmarking and peer comparison
- Executive and technical reporting
- Continuous improvement tracking
- Compliance framework mapping
- Remediation roadmap generation

Integration:
- Uses aws_connector for authentication
- Uses landscape_scanner for automated assessment
- Maps to compliance_module frameworks
- Generates architecture_patterns recommendations
